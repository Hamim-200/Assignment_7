                Difference between local storage and session storage?
            </h1>
            <p class="m-3">
                <b>Local Storage:</b> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage
                object,
                the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage
                data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the
                last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing
                or incognito session). <br>
                <b>Session Storage</b> objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
                difference
                between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                Difference between global scope and local scope?
            </h1>

            <p class="m-3">Global variables are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions
                in the script must access, such as a session id. A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it
                exists only within the block that it is declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and
                its values lost

                How does javascript event loop work?
            </h1>
            <p class="m-3 text-lg ">The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback
                Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push
                it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
