                difference between local storage and session storage?
            </h1>
            <p class="m-3">
                <b>Local Storage:</b> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage
                object,
                the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage
                data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the
                last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing
                or incognito session). <br>
                <b>Session Storage</b> objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
                difference
                between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                Difference between arrow function and Regular function?
            </h1>

            <p class="m-3">JavaScript's arrow functions might seem the same as regular functions on the surface, but
                they have some very important differences:

                Why we use Tamplate String?
            </h1>
            <p class="m-3 text-lg ">Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are
                used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders).
                However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function
                to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
