                Difference between var let and const?
            </h1>
            <p class="m-3">
                The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
                Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in
                their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
                Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to
                the immediate enclosing block.The const keyword follows the same rules as the let keyword. The only
                difference with const is that const is used to define only constant values in JavaScript programs.

                Difference between arrow function and Regular function?
            </h1>

            <p class="m-3">JavaScript's arrow functions might seem the same as regular functions on the surface, but
                they have some very important differences:

                Why we use Tamplate String?
            </h1>
            <p class="m-3 text-lg ">Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are
                used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders).
                However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function
                to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
